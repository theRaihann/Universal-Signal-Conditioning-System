# Universal Signal Conditioning System

The developed system can conduct Linearization, Filteration, Amplification, Cold-Junction Compensation on signals from temperature sensors; Ambient noise cancellation, Audio filteration, Power amplification on audio signals; Filteration, Amplification on light sensor signals. It can also attenuate, shift DC level, filter and control gain for conditioning High voltage Differential Input Signal for Low-Voltage ADCs. Moreover the system can do bridge balancing, Dc level control, Gain control for conditioning Pressure gauge signal.
